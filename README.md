# Binary to Decimal Converter

This project is a simple **Binary to Decimal Converter** that converts binary numbers into their decimal equivalents. It is designed to help users easily understand how binary numbers translate to the decimal system.

## Features

- Converts binary input to decimal output.
- Validates input to ensure only binary numbers (0s and 1s) are accepted.
- Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
- Supports numbers of any length (depending on system capabilities).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
